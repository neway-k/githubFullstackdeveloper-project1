 <p>1. Introduction to terminal, Bash Script, and Git
  1.1. Introduction to phase 3
  ● Refer to the class video
  1.2. Bash script: Mac terminal, Git Bash, and Cygwin
  ● What is Bash? It is better to define terminal, GUI, and shell before
  jumping into Bash
  ▪ Graphical User Interfaces (GUI): A GUI is a way to
  command/instruct your computer operating system (OS) using
  graphical symbols rather than typing the instructions. A GUI uses
  windows, icons, and menus to perform commands, such as opening,
  deleting, and moving files. Although a GUI operating system is
  primarily navigated using a mouse, a keyboard can also be used.
  ▪ Terminal: GUIs allow a user to accomplish daily tasks by easily
  interacting with windows and icons. However, there are commands
  that need to be manually entered via text to instruct the computer
  directly. We usually do this through terminals.</p>
